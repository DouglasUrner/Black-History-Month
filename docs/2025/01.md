# [Marsha P. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_P._Johnson) (1945-1992)

Marsha P. Johnson, the "mayor of Christopher Street" was a drag queen, a tireless advocate for gay rights, and a prominent figure in the [Stonewall Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) in the summer of 1969 in New York City. Some people credit her with throwing the first brick. Johnson was a founding member of the [Gay Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Liberation_Front), and along with her close friend Sylvia Rivera a founder of the [Street Tnansvestite Action Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Transvestite_Action_Revolutionaries).

In 1992 her body was found floating in the Hudson River. NYPD first ruled her death a suicide, but, following protests allowed the possibilty of murder. The case remains unsolved.
