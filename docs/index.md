# Black History Month

A small act of defiance as the federal government of the US tries to erase the contributions of Black Americans -- and so many others.

I've been taking this opportunity to learn more about bits of Black history that I knew enough to search up on the web, but not enough to really say much about without some research. So, I've been learning some things. Did you know that:

* The ambulances that we take for granted, stocked with life saving equipment and medications and staffed with highly trained paramedics or EMTs had their origins in the [Freedom House Ambulance Service](2025/02.md) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
* The WIC program which provides health and nutrition support to women and their children who are living in poverty had it's roots in the Black Panther Party's [Breakfast for Children](2025/05.md) and their other Service to the People Programs.

The struggles of Black Americans to uplift their community have lifted us all.
